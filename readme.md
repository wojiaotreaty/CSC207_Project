## Problem Domain
Our primary problem domain revolves around helping users stay
motivated and achieve their personal goals. This domain encompasses various challenges, including:

1. Motivation Erosion: Users often struggle to maintain their motivation over time. They may start enthusiastically but 
gradually lose interest in pursuing their goals. The challenge is to provide consistent and effective motivation to 
prevent this erosion.

2. Goal Setting and Tracking: Many individuals have difficulty setting clear and achievable goals. Additionally, they may 
struggle with tracking their progress toward these goals. The app needs to assist users in setting SMART (Specific, 
Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound) goals and tracking their journey.

_3. Content Relevance: Generating motivational messages and reminders that are relevant to each user's unique goals and 
circumstances is essential. The app should tailor content to the user's objectives, preferences, and progress._

4. Maintaining Engagement: Keeping users engaged with the app is a significant challenge. Users might lose interest if 
they perceive the app's content as repetitive or unhelpful. Ensuring that the app continues to provide value and 
motivation is vital.

_5. Balancing Gamification: Gamifying motivation can be a powerful tool, but it needs to strike a balance. Over-gamification
can lead to user fatigue, while under-gamification may fail to motivate. Finding the right mix of challenges, rewards, 
and achievements is key._

_6. Social Support and Accountability: Many users find motivation in sharing their goals and progress with friends or a 
community. The app should facilitate social interactions, provide features for sharing achievements, and offer support 
networks._

_7. Integration Complexity: Integrating with external APIs to enhance task management and calendar organization can 
introduce complexity. The app needs to seamlessly integrate these features while maintaining a user-friendly interface._

_8. Data-Driven Insights: Providing users with insights into their progress and suggesting adjustments to their goals or 
strategies based on data analytics is a valuable feature. This involves collecting and processing user data effectively._

_9. Personalization: Every user is unique, and their motivational needs vary. The app should have robust personalization 
capabilities, learning from user behavior and preferences to adapt and provide relevant content._

_10. User Retention: Retaining users over the long term is a significant challenge. The app should continually offer new 
features, challenges, and motivational content to keep users engaged and coming back._

## Description

Our team aims to create a goal setting/tracking app using OpenAI API to create AI generated 
motivational and reminder messages that are both personalized to the user, and kept unique and 
diversified to stop them from becoming mundane and ineffective. Users will have the ability to set 
long term, short term, and daily goals for themselves, with appropriate deadlines if the user 
likes. The app will then provide timely motivational messages and reminders to encourage the 
user to complete their goals. Users will also be able to see and track their progress on the 
goals they're working on or view a history of the goals they have completed or were unable to 
complete. Additionally, our app will implement gamification elements such as achievement badges 
and progress visualization to reinforce users for completing and working on their goals and
maintain app engagement.
